This way, I don't have to waste so much effort - so that I can then happily waste it on other activities, such as ranking up a videogame or climbing mountain tops.`,

        bio: `A soon to be graduated computer science engineer who loves to combine software engineering best practices with data science techniques to build impactful projects.
I have been digging in the data science field for more than one year now. During my data science journey so far I worked as an ML Engineer at Omdena(worked on social good projects, because is it even tech if its isn't impactful?), data scientist at a startup called Mylo (I brought profits to company using NLP along with increasing the platform engagement by 2x) and as a MLH fellow where I spent amazing 12 weeks contributing to machine learning and deep learning organizations including scikit-learn, Keras and BentoML.

Currently, I am working as a Junior Team Lead at MLH (because sharing my experience with others helps me to learn more and build a community), where I manage 10 brilliant fellows in US and Canada.

Diversity matters a lot to me and to empower women in tech I lead Women Who Code Python track. They have some amazing study groups and AMA webinars going on that are led me.
